# MQL4-for-Avatrade-MT4
This is a repository to help traders initiate using MT4 at a given broker (Avatrade).  
There are many brokers and platforms.  I just use MT4 and Avatrade to help instroduce others to the foundation required to create a trading bot.
The video is helpful to create an demo account to start, download the platform.
The additional files to run by bot are not available to the public as I can't guarantee its results.
The aim of this repository is to help others initiate thru what it took me a while to digest and learn, then to create a trading bot.
